# My little Ruby programs

Once you start your ruby advanture you will soon find out you have many
applications which can be run direclty from command line.

In this repository you will find quizzes, games, puzzles and some little quirky programs.
From 2 to over 300 lines of code.

## Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/KrzysztofBalejko/Ruby-Algorithms-Codewars-kata.git `

You don't need to install any additional gems.

Please take time to get yourself familiar with projects first (see below)

## Bash users

Please note some of those little apps will perform slightly better in PowerShell.

You can still go ahead using bash though. Have fun!

## Projects:

*Bar Graphs*

Quirky little program will ask the user for a list of numbers.
The user enters them separated by commas, e.g.: `10,4,2,7,5,1`.
Program will print a horizontal bar graph of the numbers in order.

*Black Jack*

Black Jack is a program that will ask the user either to enter 'hit' or 'stick'
On 'hit' new card is randomly allocated and stored in user's array(hand) of cards.
Each of the cards has different point value.
On 'stick' the score is being displayed.
The score depends on the cards user is holding in hand.

*Numbers Converter*

Program will convert your numbers to words ie.:
5 = "five",
14 = "fourteen"
77 = "seventy-seven"

*People Into Groups*

Program will put people into groups.  It will:
- Ask the user to enter the number of groups they want to create.
- Ask for people's names, one at a time, until the user enters `stop`.
- Ask the user for the number of a group.
- Program will then print the people in that group

Grouping strategy:
   * As an example, imagine there are three groups.
   * First person goes in the first group.
   * Second person goes in the second group.
   * Third person goes in the third group.
   * Fourth person goes in the first group.
   * Fifth person goes in the second group.
   
*Scrabble Calculator*

Program calculates the score for a word in Scrabble.
You will be asked to enter a word e.g. `apple`.
In return you will receive the score for the word.

Points for each letter:
     * 0 points: blank tile
     * 1 point: E, A, I, O, N, R, T, L, S, U
     * 2 points: D, G
     * 3 points: B, C, M, P
     * 4 points: F, H, V, W, Y
     * 5 points: K
     * 8 points: J, X
     * 10 points: Q, Z

*Star Wars Quiz*

Who doesn't like Star Wars? I'm a huge fan!

- Ask user a question at random and there will be 10 of them
- It will keep the track of the score
- At the end of the quiz program will display the score
